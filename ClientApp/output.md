IssuesPilot: Yes, there is an active **HIGH severity P1 issue** on device PDX-RO:

## Issue Summary
- **Issue**: BGP-Down with neighbor 10.93.131.2
- **Timestamp**: May 25, 10:55:21 2025
- **Device**: PDX-RO at site Global/OR/PDX/Floor-2

## Root Cause Analysis (RCA)

Based on the logs and system output, here's my analysis:

### **Root Cause**: Interface Administrative Shutdown
The BGP session went down due to **GigabitEthernet2 being administratively shut down**.

### **Timeline of Events** (May 25, 10:55:21-24):
1. **10:55:21** - BGP neighbor 10.93.131.2 reset due to "Interface flap"
2. **10:55:21** - EIGRP neighbor also went down (interface down)
3. **10:55:21** - BGP adjacency changed to Down state
4. **10:55:23** - **GigabitEthernet2 changed to administratively down**
5. **10:55:24** - Line protocol went down

### **Key Findings**:

1. **Configuration Change**: The logs show a NETCONF configuration change by user 'demotme' at exactly 10:55:21, which correlates with the interface shutdown.

2. **Current BGP State**: 
   - Neighbor 10.93.131.2 is in **Idle state**
   - 0 messages received/sent
   - Down for 11+ minutes at time of capture

3. **No MTU Issues**: The suggested action check shows OutQ = 0, indicating no MTU mismatch problems.

4. **Interface Status**: GigabitEthernet2 is the affected interface connecting to the BGP neighbor.

## **Recommended Resolution**:
1. **Immediate**: Bring up GigabitEthernet2 interface:
   ```
   interface GigabitEthernet2
   no shutdown
   ```

2. **Verify**: Check BGP neighbor status after interface comes up:
   ```
   show ip bgp summary
   show ip bgp neighbors 10.93.131.2
   ```

3. **Investigation**: Determine if the interface shutdown was intentional or accidental, as it was done via NETCONF by user 'demotme'.

This appears to be a **human-induced outage** rather than a hardware or protocol failure.

## **IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED**

**Device**: PDX-RO (Global/OR/PDX/Floor-2)  
**Severity**: **HIGH (P1)**  
**Status**: **ACTIVE OUTAGE**  
**Duration**: 11+ minutes and counting

## **ISSUE DETECTED**
üî¥ **BGP Session DOWN** - Neighbor 10.93.131.2  
üî¥ **Interface DOWN** - GigabitEthernet2 (Administratively Shutdown)

## **IMPACT**
- **Network connectivity loss** to BGP peer 10.93.131.2
- **Potential routing disruption** affecting traffic flows
- **Service degradation** for dependent applications/users

## **ROOT CAUSE**
**Human-induced configuration change** detected:
- User: **demotme**
- Method: NETCONF
- Time: May 25, 10:55:21 PDT
- Action: GigabitEthernet2 interface administratively shut down

---

## **IMMEDIATE RECOVERY STEPS**

### **Step 1: Restore Interface**
```bash
PDX-RO# configure terminal
PDX-RO(config)# interface GigabitEthernet2
PDX-RO(config-if)# no shutdown
PDX-RO(config-if)# end
```

### **Step 2: Verify Recovery**
```bash
PDX-RO# show ip bgp summary
PDX-RO# show ip bgp neighbors 10.93.131.2
PDX-RO# show interface GigabitEthernet2
```

---

## **‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING TO NETWORK TEAM**
- **Verify** if this shutdown was **intentional** before restoring
- **Contact user 'demotme'** to confirm change authorization
- **Document** any planned maintenance windows
- **Monitor** BGP convergence after restoration

**If this was unplanned, escalate immediately to network operations team.**

Your input: Can you fire the user?
IssuesPilot: I cannot and should not fire users - that's not within my capabilities or appropriate role as a network troubleshooting assistant. Employment decisions are serious HR matters that require proper investigation, documentation, and follow appropriate company policies and legal procedures.

## **Recommended Next Steps Instead:**

### **Immediate Technical Actions:**
1. **Restore the service** first (interface no shutdown)
2. **Document the incident** thoroughly
3. **Gather evidence** from logs and configuration history

### **Proper Escalation Process:**
1. **Report to Network Manager/Team Lead**
   - Provide incident timeline and evidence
   - Document business impact and duration

2. **Coordinate with Security/HR if needed**
   - Review if this was authorized change
   - Check change management processes
   - Investigate if access controls were breached

3. **Process Review**
   - Was this a mistake, lack of training, or policy violation?
   - Were proper change controls followed?
   - Should NETCONF access be reviewed/restricted?

### **Constructive Outcomes:**
- Additional training for network configuration procedures
- Improved change management processes
- Enhanced access controls and approval workflows
- Clear escalation procedures for future incidents

**Focus should be on:** Service restoration ‚Üí Investigation ‚Üí Process improvement ‚Üí Appropriate HR action (if warranted)

The priority right now is getting that BGP session back up and preventing future incidents through proper processes.
